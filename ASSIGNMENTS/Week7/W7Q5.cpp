/*Q5) A fintech company is developing a unified digital payment platform that supports multiple payment
methods. The development team has already designed the following base structure:
The payment platform must support a new hybrid payment method called SmartWallet which combines
features of both online authentication and card-based payment processing. The final program should:
 Represent the SmartWallet payment method using appropriate inheritance relationships.
 Ensure the payment system can handle different payment types through a common payment
interface.
 Demonstrate how authentication and payment processing occur for the SmartWallet method.
 Provide a reusable mechanism that can execute payment operations without knowing the exact
payment type at compile time.
 Clearly show that the correct payment behavior is selected dynamically at runtime.
