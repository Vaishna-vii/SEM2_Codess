/*Assignment 2
 Dynamic Memory Allocation & Pointer Arithmetic

1. Assume there are three integer elements in the array A= {10,100,200} that are stored at
addresses 0xbfa088b0, 0xbfa088b4, 0xbfa088b8
Note: The address can vary from system to system.
WAP in C++ to perform following operations using pointer arithmetic.
(i) Increment a Pointer (++)
Sample output after incrementing pointer: Address of var[0] = 0xbfa088b0
Value of var[0] = 10
Address of var[1] = 0xbfa088b4 Value of var[1] = 100
Address of var[2] = 0xbfa088b8 Value of var[2] = 200
(ii) Decrement a Pointer (--)
Sample output after decrementing pointer: Address of var[3] = 0xbfdb70f8
Value of var[3] = 200
Address of var[2] = 0xbfdb70f4 Value of var[2] = 100
Address of var[1] = 0xbfdb70f0 Value of var[1] = 10
2. WAP in C++ to store CGPA of n number of students using dynamic memory allocation
where ‘n’ is the number of students entered by the user. Display the details of the
students.
3. WAP to calculate the sum of n integers stored in an array. Ask user to enter the n integers
at run time.
Classes and Objects

4. Define a class to represent a bank account. The class should include the following:
a. Data Members (Appropriate details such as account holder name, account number,
and balance.)
b. Member Functions
i. A function to assign initial values
ii. A function to deposit an amount
iii. A function to withdraw an amount after checking sufficient balance
iv. A function to display the account holder’s name and balance
c. Write a main() function to test the class.
5. Define a class to represent a vector (a list of float values). Include member functions to
perform the following tasks:
a. To create/initialize the vector
b. To modify elements by adding a scalar value
c. To multiply all elements by a scalar value
d. To display the vector in the form: (10, 20, 30, ...)
6. Create a class named First with a data member string studentName and a member
function printName(). The program should create an object of the class and print the
student’s name using the member function.
7. Write a C++ program to compute the area of a rectangle. Create a class named Area with
two member functions:
a. setDim() – to accept the length and breadth of the rectangle
b. getArea() – to return the area of the rectangle
Use a main() function to test the class.*/
